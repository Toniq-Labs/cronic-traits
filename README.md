# Basic Guide
Every Cronic has 32 bytes of data, which represent "genes" or DNA. Each set of DNA is made of 20 traits, 10 visual and 10 battle traits. 5 of the visual traits affect different visual elements of each Cronic, and the other 5 affect the color.

There are 10 battle traits with values between 0 - 63. The traits `basic` and `special` correspond to yet to be announced attack types. These values do not mean much at this point in time.

The remaining 8 battle traits are pure values - the higher the better.

## Dominant vs Recessive

Each trait has two genes, a dominant and recessive, but these should be treated as Active and Inactive. The Dominant/Active gene is the one that affects a given Cronic, but when breeding there is a 50:50* chance that either will be passed. Therefore, there is a 25%* chance that a child would contain a specific gene from a single parent.
